# JSON Networking

Machines here and any other emulator speaking the same protocol can sit on one
virtual network, by all connecting to a JSON tun/tap server. The protocol is
Charles Ferguson's, and RISC OS Pyromaniac speaks it, so a machine here and a
Pyromaniac elsewhere can reach each other.

The server is a single Python file:
<https://github.com/gerph/tuntap-json-server>. It listens on TCP, and every
frame it is given it replicates to every other client, and to a real tap
interface if it has been given one. Pyromaniac has spoken this for years, as its
`etherdriverjson` configuration group; this is the other end of the same wire.

## Why it exists, when there is already a local wire

Machines running on one host already see each other without any of this, over a
loopback hub that needs no configuration (see [multi-machine.md](multi-machine.md)).
The JSON server is for the things that hub cannot do:

- **It crosses hosts.** The server can run on a Linux box while emulators on
  Windows and macOS connect to it over the network. Only the machine running the
  server needs a tap, and creating one on Linux is far easier than on the other
  two.
- **It is one place to watch the whole network.** Every frame passes through the
  server, so the traffic can be captured or traced in one place rather than per
  machine.
- **Other emulators can join.** Pyromaniac today; anything else that speaks the
  format tomorrow.

## Setting it up

Run the server somewhere. With no tap it needs no privileges and no setup:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gerph/tuntap-json-server
python3 tuntap-json-server/tap_jsonserver.py --port 33445
```

Add `--tap-enable` when the virtual network should also reach the real one; that
is the part that needs a tap and the privileges to make one.

Then point machines at it, in the machine editor under **Network**, in the
**JSON Networking** box: tick the option, give the server's host name and
port. Or per run, without editing the machine:

```sh
./rpcemu-recompiler --machine os530 --json-net myserver:33445
./rpcemu-recompiler --machine os371 --json-net myserver --headless
./rpcemu-recompiler --machine os530 --json-net off
```

`off` takes a machine whose settings have it on out of the network for that run.
The port defaults to 33445, the server's own default. The option works the same
for the window and for `--headless`.

## What it does to the rest of the networking

**The machine stops using the local wire.** Both are hubs that carry every frame
to everyone, so a machine on both would send each frame to its local peers and
to the server, which would replicate it to those same peers if they were also
connected. Everything would arrive twice. A machine that names a server uses the
server and nothing else; `network_nat_init()` enforces it, and the log says which
wire a machine is on.

**Its own way out to the internet is unaffected.** NAT carries on as before;
this decides which other emulators the machine can see, not how it reaches the
outside world.

## Addresses are yours to arrange

This carries Ethernet frames and nothing more. Two machines that are to talk IP
still have to agree addresses.

Guests are given `.10` upwards on this installation's own network by their own
SLiRP, where the last part follows a slot claimed at startup: the first machine
started is `.10`, the second `.11`, and so on. Anything else joining the same
network needs an address on it that does not collide.

**The slot only distinguishes machines started by one RPCEmu**, which is the
catch here. Two machines meeting over a server were started by different RPCEmus,
each handing its first machine the same address - distinct MAC addresses and one
IP address, which cannot work and says nothing about why. So the network itself
is a setting - put the two installations on different ones, from Settings →
Networking in the Manager. See [guest-network.md](guest-network.md).

MAC addresses are given to a machine when it first starts and kept in its
configuration, so two machines differ whoever started them.

## The format

One JSON object per line, and the Ethernet header is taken apart rather than
sent whole:

```json
{"frame_type": 2048, "src": [6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "dst": [255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255], "data": "aGVsbG8="}
```

`dst` is bytes 0 to 5 of the frame, `src` is 6 to 11, `frame_type` is the
big-endian halfword at 12 and 13, and `data` is base64 of everything from byte 14
on - the payload, not the frame. Getting that last part wrong is the easy
mistake, and it is why `tests/test_net_json.c` checks the encoding byte for byte
rather than only round-tripping it through itself.

## What has been checked

The encoding and decoding are tested against the format as the server implements
it, including every byte value through base64, payload lengths either side of a
base64 group, malformed lines being refused, and lines without the spacing that
the server's own `json.dumps` happens to produce. Our encoder's output has been
compared against the server's encoder for the same frame and is identical.

**Not yet done: a running RPCEmu and a running Pyromaniac exchanging traffic
through a live server.** The format is right and the transport works; whether
two guest operating systems then talk to each other is the next thing to
confirm.
