 * A SWI counts because the alternative is being dropped on the hardware vector

 * at the test below for why only backward and only conditional.
 *
 * Falls back to a plain step whenever the instruction cannot be read or is not
 * one of those. Stepping into is always safe; running away is not, so an
 * uncertain case must degrade towards the step.
