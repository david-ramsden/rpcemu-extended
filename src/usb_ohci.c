/*
 * usb_ohci.c - an OHCI USB host controller.
 *
 * See usb_ohci.h for why this replaced the ISP1161 that was here.
 *
 * The shape of OHCI is quite different from what came before. The ISP1161 kept
 * its descriptors in its own buffer RAM and the driver pushed them through a
 * data port, so the emulation ran a list when the driver had finished handing
 * one over. OHCI instead keeps everything in main memory - a communication area
 * the driver tells us about once, and linked lists of endpoint and transfer
 * descriptors hanging off it - and the controller is expected to walk them
 * under its own steam, once a frame. So the work happens on the frame tick, and
 * this file reaches into guest memory to do it.
 *
 * That reaching-in is the thing a real Risc PC expansion card could not do, and
 * the reason the ISP1161 was chosen in the first place. It is free here.
 *
 * Everything below the descriptor layer is unchanged: a device is still the
 * three questions in usb_device.h, and a passed-through device from the host
 * still answers them through libusb, none the wiser.
