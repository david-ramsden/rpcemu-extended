 * among them, which is what Raspberry Pi OS is built on. The header then exists

 *
 * Rather than refuse to build, RPCEmu builds without the two features that need
 * it: the package manager and downloading RISC OS. Everything else is
 * unaffected, and each entry point says what is missing and why instead of
 * failing obscurely. Testing wxUSE_WEBREQUEST directly rather than adding a
 * build option of our own means there is nothing for anybody to set wrongly:
 * a tree either has the support or it does not.
