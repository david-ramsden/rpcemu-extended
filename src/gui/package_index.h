 * Each is a text file of control records, one per package, in the format the
 * RISC OS Packaging Project's policy manual defines: fields as "Name: value",
 * continuation lines indented by a space, records separated by a blank line.
 * Every record carries the URL of the package's zip and an MD5 to check it by.
 *
 * This reads those indexes. It installs nothing and knows nothing about a
 * machine; see package_db.h for what is installed and package_install.h for
 * putting it there.
