/*
 * usb_dialog.cpp - what is plugged into the emulated USB ports.
 *
 * The choices are written into the machine's configuration and then applied, so
 * the configuration is the one account of what is plugged in: a machine started
 * again tomorrow has the same devices, and the dialogue is only a way of editing
 * it. Applying goes through the emulator's command queue, because the controller
 * belongs to that thread.
 *
 * What is on offer is the real devices plugged into this computer. Handing one
 * over is not a neutral act - the host's own driver is detached while the guest
 * has it - so a device the host is using is marked as such and takes a
 * confirmation, and a device that cannot be opened at all says why rather than
 * failing silently later.
 *
 * The dialogue is deliberately blunt about the state of the software on the
 * guest side too. A device that RISC OS has no driver for is still worth
 * attaching, since the emulation can be developed against it, but a user who
 * attaches something and sees nothing happen deserves to be told why rather
 * than left guessing.
