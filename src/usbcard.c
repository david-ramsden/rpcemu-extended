/*
 * usbcard.c - the USB expansion card.
 *
 * An OHCI host controller and a ROM to carry the module that tells RISC OS
 * about it. A card of its own rather than part of the support card, because it
 * needs that ROM and because an expansion card with one interrupt and one thing
 * raising it is a great deal easier to reason about - the previous arrangement,
 * where the USB controller shared the support card with the scroll wheel, wedged
 * machines outright.
 *
 * Which slot it lands in no longer matters. The card's ROM carries RISC OS's own
 * USB stack - USBDriver and OHCIDriver - and a card ROM starts the modules it
 * carries with r11 pointing at the card, so OHCIDriver drives the card it came
 * out of rather than a slot number somebody wrote down. The support card has its
 * historical slot 0 back.
 *
 * The stock OHCIDriver cannot do that: it finds controllers by asking the HAL
 * what USB hardware exists, and the IOMD HAL has no USB support at all. See
 * docs/usb.md for the patch that adds the expansion card case.
