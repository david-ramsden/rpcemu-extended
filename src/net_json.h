/*
 * net_json - Ethernet frames over a JSON tun/tap server, so machines here and
 * any other emulator speaking the protocol sit on one virtual network.
 *
 * The protocol is Charles Ferguson's, and RISC OS Pyromaniac has spoken it for
 * years (its `etherdriverjson` configuration group).
 *
 * A server listens on TCP, replicates every frame it is given to every other
 * client, and optionally to a real tap interface. That last part is the reason to
 * support it rather than only our own loopback wire: the server can run on a
 * Linux box where creating a tap is straightforward, and Windows and macOS
 * emulators can join it over the network without any of them needing a tap of
 * their own. It also gives one place to watch the whole virtual LAN, which a
 * peer-to-peer design cannot.
 *
 * ★ Not used at the same time as net_switch.
 *
 * Both are hubs. An instance on both would send each frame to its loopback
 * peers AND to the server, which replicates it to the same peers if they are
 * also connected, and every frame would arrive twice. So a machine configured
 * with a server uses that as its ONLY machine-to-machine wire, and machines
 * started on this computer are unreachable unless they are on the same server;
 * network-nat.c enforces it, from net_json_wants_connection() rather than from
 * whether the server is currently answering.
 *
 * This is the local wire only. NAT is untouched - slirp_input() is called for
 * every frame whatever wire it went to - so the machine reaches the outside
 * world exactly as it would otherwise.
 *
 * WIRE FORMAT. One JSON object per line, and the Ethernet header is taken
 * apart rather than sent whole:
 *
 *     {"frame_type": 2048, "src": [6,2,3,4,5,6],
 *      "dst": [255,255,255,255,255,255], "data": "<base64 payload>"}
 *
 * `data` is the payload only - everything from byte 14 onwards. dst is bytes
 * 0..5, src is 6..11, and frame_type is the big-endian halfword at 12..13. The
 * server does the same split when it reads from a tap, so this is the format
 * and not an interpretation of it.
 *
 * ADDRESSES. This carries frames and nothing else. Two machines that are to
 * talk IP still have to agree addresses between them. Every machine here is on
 * 100.64.0.0/10 with an address derived from its own MAC (guest_subnet.h), so
 * machines from any number of installations meet on one network with addresses
 * that differ without anything being configured or negotiated. Anything else
 * joining the same wire needs an address on that network that does not collide.
