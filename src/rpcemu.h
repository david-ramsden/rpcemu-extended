 * The display settings.
 *
 * These began as three independent switches - integer_scaling, fit_to_window and
 * follow_host_display - which was the source of most of the confusion around
 * them. They then became two choices: where the RISC OS desktop's size came from
 * (best for this display, follow the window, or a fixed size) and how it was
 * drawn (actual size, whole multiples, fill the window).
 *
 * The automatic halves of that are gone, and what is left is a screen size and
 * how to draw it. The reason is worth recording, because on paper "the desktop
 * follows the window" is the nicer feature:
 *
 *   RISC OS will not adopt an arbitrary screen mode. It accepts only modes the
 *   monitor definition in force declares, and on a real machine that definition
 *   is a definition file the guest's own !Boot loads - not the EDID this
 *   emulator synthesises. Measured on a machine with the graphics card fitted,
 *   seven of the thirteen modes that fit its display memory were refused, and
 *   not the ones anybody would guess: 1920x1200 accepted, 1920x1080 refused.
 *
 * So a desktop that follows the window can only ever land on a coarse and
 * unpredictable set of sizes. Every intermediate window size left either a black
 * border or a stretch, and every mode change moved and resized the window while
 * the user was still dragging it. Chasing the window was producing worse
 * behaviour than not chasing it.
 *
 * A named resolution has none of those problems. It is advertised as the
 * monitor's native mode, so the machine boots straight into it; the window is
 * that size and stays that size; and nothing moves on its own.
