# Windows needs one extra thing: the emulator is a GUI-subsystem binary there
# (no console window when double-clicked), so it has no terminal to write to and
# reports these messages in a dialog instead. RPCEMU_NO_GUI_MESSAGES=1 sends
# them to stdout/stderr, which is both what a script would set and what makes
# this testable. It is harmless elsewhere.
