/*
 * The JSON wire format, shared with every other emulator that speaks it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. This is an interoperability format owned by somebody else:
 * https://github.com/gerph/tuntap-json-server decides what it is, and if we
 * disagree with it there is nobody to notice on our side. A frame goes out, the
 * server accepts the line, and the other end quietly makes something different
 * of it - or drops it, which looks exactly like a machine that is not there.
 *
 * The part most easily got wrong is that "data" is the PAYLOAD and not the
 * frame. The server lifts the destination, source and type out of the Ethernet
 * header and sends them as their own fields (tap_jsonserver.py:370-373), so a
 * base64 of the whole frame would be accepted by the JSON parser at the far end
 * and produce a frame with fourteen bytes of rubbish in front of the payload.
 *
 * These check the encoding against that layout byte for byte, and check that a
 * line survives the round trip unchanged.
