@
@ The guest half of the emulated graphics card. The card carries its own
@ framestore, so the modes it can show are limited by the card's memory rather
@ than by how much VRAM is fitted to the machine: 2560x1440 in full colour, where
@ VIDC20 with 2MB of VRAM stops at 800x600.
@
@ This is an ordinary GraphicsV driver. It registers with OS_ScreenMode 64,
@ claims GraphicsV, and answers the calls the kernel makes to drive a display:
@ what the hardware can do, where its framestore is, what mode to program, where
@ to scan out from, and the palette. Everything it needs to know about the card
@ it reads from the card's own registers, which it finds through the address the
@ Podule manager reports for the slot. There is nothing machine-specific here and
@ nothing patched.
@
@ The card does not become the display just by being present: RISC OS keeps using
@ VIDC20 until asked to switch. *GfxCardOn switches to the card and *GfxCardOff
@ switches back, and *GfxCardStatus shows what is going on.
@
@ The approach follows the precedent set by ViewFinder, John Kortink's graphics
@ expansion card for the Acorn Risc PC, which showed that a card-hosted
@ framestore driven by its own display driver could take the machine well beyond
@ VIDC20's limits. No ViewFinder code, firmware or programming interface is used;
@ this driver is written from the GraphicsV documentation in the RISC OS sources.
@
@ GraphicsV and OS_ScreenMode 64 are RISC OS 5 features, so unlike the other
@ modules here this one is 32-bit only and uses mrs/msr where it needs the mode.
@ On an older RISC OS the driver declines to initialise and says why.

	@ ARMv3 is the RiscPC floor (ARM610/710); mrs/msr arrived with it.
